Today, we will cover writing a lexer/parser in C++ for a toy language.



## Intro to C++ (Part 3)

Let's first cover the grammar of our toy language. Our toy langauge will be an untyped lambda calculus variant. The abstract syntax of the langauge looks as follows:

```ocaml
Terms           t ::= x | fun x -> t | t t | true | false | if t then t else t | n | t + t | t * t | let x = t in t
Naturals        n ::= Nat
Variables       x ::= String
```

First, we will rewrite our grammar to be unambiguous. This should always be the first step because it makes writing the recursive descent parser a mechanical translation.

```
term
    :
    | 'fun' IDENTIIFER '->' term
    | 'if' term 'then' term 'else' term
    | 'let' IDENTIFIER '=' term 'in' term
    | add_term
    ;

add_term
    : mul_term ('+' mul_term)*
    ;

mul_term
    : application ('*' application)*
    ;

application:
    : atom atom*
    ;

atom
    : '(' term ')'
    | 'true'
    | 'false'
    | NATURAL
    | variable
    ;

variable: IDENTIFIER
```

For example, here is a program that adds 5 and 7 in our toy language:

```ocaml
let add = fun x -> fun y -> x + y in add 5 7
```

First, let's start with the build file for our project. Since we covered [Makefiles in the previous recitation](@/recitations/recitation2.md#make), we won't go over the details of the Makefile here. The Makefile is as follows:

```
SRCS := $(shell find . -name "*.cpp")
OBJS := $(SRCS:%.cpp=%.o)

parser: $(OBJS)
	g++ -g -std=c++20 -o parser $^

clean:
	rm -rf parser *.o

%.o: %.cpp
	g++ -g -std=c++20 -c $< -o $@
```

For our `main.cpp` file, we will start with this boilerplate which just reads in the file contents from `argv[1]` and prints it to stdout.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <filename>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::string filename = argv[1];
    std::ifstream file(filename);
    std::string contents = std::string(std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file), std::istreambuf_iterator<char>());
    std::cout << contents << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

We will switch to [`6112-fa26/recitation3`](https://github.com/6112-fa26/recitation3) *(which will be uploaded after the recitation)* and continue live coding for the remainder of the recitation.
